What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?


In this course we were building programs that could find and edit bids through that database and in the final project we needed to build a code to load a course list and print it as well. The CSV files allowed to access this data and manage it.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I had somewhat of an understanding of what the lesson plans were implementing throughout this course. They build on each other and I was able to figure out what the objective of each program through that. I was able to understand the data structures this way and obtain my goals through each assignment. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The main issue I had with building the progams was running the debug and eventually. I was eventually able to look up the correct codes and figure out how to get the programs to a state that they were ableto become executable and run properly. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

While coding itself is fairly easy to learn I am still having trouble understanding the basics of Psuedocodes. However that has allowed me to visualize and plan out a project better.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has helped me self-evaluate the ways I was building my code and improve on what was needed improved on through various feedback. The biggest factor in creating an executable program that can properly run is having a functioning database that can work with it.
